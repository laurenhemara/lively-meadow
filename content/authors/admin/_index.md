## Kia ora!

I'm a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Microbiome Manipulation Lab at The University of Toronto Scarborough](https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/labs/microbiomemanipulationlab/).

 **I'm passionate about understanding microbial evolution and niche adaptation, from laboratory environments to the field ‚Äî and back again!**

 My current research seeks to examine tradeoffs between the production, storage, and field application of microbial bioinoculants for agriculture, as part of the Genome Canada-funded [BENEFIT project](https://www.queensu.ca/microbes-for-agriculture/).
 
 My doctoral research used the kiwifruit pathogen *Pseudomonas syringae* pv. *actinidiae* to understand how plant pathogens evolve during incursions. Using this horticulturally-relevant pathosystem, we examined effector requirements, redundancies, and repertoire refinement across susceptible, tolerant, and resistant hosts.
