summmary: Evaluation and evolution of elite agricultural bioinoculants across production landscapes.

As part of the BENEFIT project, I'm evaluating performance and examining tradeoffs of candidate inoculants across the industrial production pipeline. 

Chemical fertiliser production and use make significant contributions to greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for 20% of agricultural emissions in Canada. To meet reduction targets, we need alternative methods to promote crop yield. Microbial bioinoculants have tremendous potential to support the sustainable intensification of agriculture, yet their unpredictable establishment and in-field function are major barriers to uptake. Overcoming this requires a broader focus on environmental compatibility throughout inoculant development. While current inoculant selection and production practices largely focus on target plant growth-promoting traits, a commercially viable inoculant must be fit across the different production landscapes presented by the industrial production pipeline and varied field conditions - necessitating a wide niche breadth and potentially opposing traits. 

The BENEFIT project is establishing a genomics-informed inoculant development pipeline to evaluate and improve the performance of Canadian soil microbes across diverse landscapes. As part of this effort, our collaborators have established the Canadian Collection of Agricultural Soil Microbes (CCASM), which we are now evaluating to identify potential pipeline generalists (with good fitness across multiple environments) and specialists (which excel in a specific environment). Assessing in-culture growth, desiccation tolerance, and in-soil growth has allowed us to characterise industrially relevant properties and environmental compatibility. Performance across these environments indicates that many soil microbes have the potential to be pipeline generalists. 

Future work will leverage experimental evolution to enhance the performance of select candidates across these production landscapes. Furthermore, we will investigate potential tradeoffs across environments and the extent to which we can select for multiple traits simultaneously. Ultimately, we aim to produce effective Canadian inoculants that perform across crops, soils, and the entire commercial production process. The optimal strategy for achieving this broad environmental compatibility – such as a single elite generalist, or a consortium of specialists – remains to be seen.
