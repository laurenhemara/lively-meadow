summmary: Genome biosurveillance of New Zealand’s Psa3 population over a 12-year period.
---
Genome biosurveillance of New Zealand’s Psa3 population has provided insights into how plant pathogens adapt over time. In particular, we have observed effector loss on both susceptible and resistant kiwifruit vines, which in some cases allows a partial escape from host resistance.
