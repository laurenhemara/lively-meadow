Genome biosurveillance of New Zealandâ€™s Psa3 population has provided insights into how plant pathogens adapt over time and highlights the importance of carefully managing recurrent pathogen infections. In particular, we have observed effector loss on both susceptible and resistant kiwifruit vines. Whether they occur in monocultures, diverse germplasm collections, or escaped wild vines, these repeated exposure events offer the pathogen an opportunity to break down resistance.
