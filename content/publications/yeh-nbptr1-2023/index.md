abstract: '*Pseudomonas syringae* pv. actinidiae biovar 3 (Psa3) causes a devastating canker disease in yellow-fleshed kiwifruit (*Actinidia chinensis*). The effector HopZ5, which is present in all isolates of Psa3 causing global outbreaks of pandemic kiwifruit canker disease, triggers immunity in Nicotiana benthamiana and is not recognised in susceptible *A. chinensis* cultivars. In a search for N. benthamiana non-host resistance genes against HopZ5, we found that the nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptor NbPTR1 recognised HopZ5. RPM1-interacting protein 4 (RIN4) orthologues from multiple plants, including kiwifruit, were associated with NbPTR1-mediated autoimmunity suppression and recognition of HopZ5. No functional orthologues of NbPTR1 were found in *A. chinensis*. NbPTR1 transformed into Psa3-susceptible *A. chinensis* var. *chinensis* ‘Hort16A’ plants introduced HopZ5-specific resistance against Psa3. Altogether, this study suggested that expressing NbPTR1 in Psa3-susceptible kiwifruit is a viable approach to acquiring resistance to Psa3 and it provides valuable information for engineering resistance in otherwise susceptible kiwifruit genotypes.'
summary: By transforming the NbPTR1 resistance gene into susceptible kiwifruit, we have engineered HopZ5-specific resistance against Psa3.
