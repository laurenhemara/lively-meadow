abstract: A pandemic isolate of *Pseudomonas syringae* pv. actinidiae biovar 3 (Psa3)
  has devastated kiwifruit orchards growing cultivars of *Actinidia chinensis*. In contrast,
  *A. arguta* (kiwiberry) is not a host of Psa3. Resistance is mediated via effector-triggered
  immunity, as demonstrated by induction of the hypersensitive response in infected
  *A. arguta* leaves, observed by microscopy and quantified by ion-leakage assays. Isolates
  of Psa3 that cause disease in *A. arguta* have been isolated and analyzed, revealing
  a 51 kb deletion in the exchangeable effector locus (EEL). This natural EEL-mutant
  isolate and strains with synthetic knockouts of the EEL were more virulent in *A.
  arguta* plantlets than wild-type Psa3. Screening of a complete library of Psa3 effector
  knockout strains identified increased growth in planta for knockouts of four effectors–AvrRpm1a,
  HopF1c, HopZ5a, and the EEL effector HopAW1a –suggesting a resistance response in
  *A. arguta*. Hypersensitive response (HR) assays indicate that three of these effectors
  trigger a host species-specific HR. A Psa3 strain with all four effectors knocked
  out escaped host recognition, but a cumulative increase in bacterial pathogenicity
  and virulence was not observed. These avirulence effectors can be used in turn to
  identify the first cognate resistance genes in *Actinidia* for breeding durable resistance
  into future kiwifruit cultivars.
summary: Four  avirulence effectors contribute to Psa3 recognition in resistant kiwiberry, identified through genome biosurveillance and effector knockout screening.
