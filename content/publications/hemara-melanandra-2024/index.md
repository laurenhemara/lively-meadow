abstract: '*Pseudomonas syringae* pv. actinidiae biovar 3 (Psa3) has decimated kiwifruit orchards growing susceptible kiwifruit *Actinidia chinensis* varieties. Effector loss has occurred recently in Psa3 isolates from resistant kiwifruit germplasm, resulting in strains capable of partially overcoming resistance present in kiwiberry vines (*A. arguta*, *A. polygama*, and *A. melanandra*). Diploid male *A. melanandra* recognises several effectors, sharing recognition of at least one avirulence effector (HopAW1a) with previously studied tetraploid kiwiberry vines. Sequencing and assembly of the *A. melanandra* genome enabled the characterisation of the transcriptomic response of this non-host to wild-type and genetic mutants of Psa3. *A. melanandra* appears to mount a classic effector-triggered immunity (ETI) response to wildtype Psa3 V-13, as expected. Surprisingly, the type III secretion (T3SS) system-lacking Psa3 V-13 ∆hrcC strain did not appear to trigger pattern40 triggered immunity (PTI) despite lacking the ability to deliver immunity-suppressing effectors. Contrasting the *A. melanandra* responses to an effectorless Psa3 V-13 ∆33E strain and to Psa3 V-13 ∆hrcC suggested that PTI triggered by Psa3 V-13 was based on the recognition of the T3SS itself. The characterisation of both ETI and PTI branches of innate immunity responses within *A. melanandra* further enables breeding for durable resistance in future kiwifruit cultivars.'
summary: Through genome biosurveillance, effector screening, and transcriptomics, we characterised the immune response of resistant Actinidia melanandra to Psa3.
