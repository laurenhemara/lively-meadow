abstract: 'Host specificity of a plant pathogen is defined by its effector complement. However, it remains unclear whether the full complement is required for pathogenicity. *Pseudomonas syringae* pv. *actinidiae* (Psa) is an emerging model pathogen of kiwifruit with over 30 functional effectors, providing a unique opportunity to understand how host-mediated selection shapes pathogen evolution. The majority of Psaâ€™s effectors previously appeared non-essential in single knockout contexts. Why, then, does Psa maintain such a large repertoire? We sought to examine effector requirements, redundancies, and repertoire refinement across host genotypes through a mutated effector-leveraging evolution experiment (MELEE), serially passaging competitive populations of effector knockout strains. Competition suggests that all effectors are collectively required for successful virulence, demonstrated by the dominance of wild-type. Host-specific effector requirements identified may further explain the maintenance of this large effector repertoire, providing important insights into the dynamics of effector redundancy following incursions.'
summary: Through MELEE, a mutated effector-leveraging evolution experiment, we identified that the majority of Psa3's effectors are collectively required for virulence.
